# Willow Library

This is a general Unity package that contains an assortment of things that I (Alice Bottino) use to make games.

This is the package that I import into *every* project I make, which means it contains a fairly eclectic collection of tools. 
Feel free to use anything here, but it is worth noting that I do not make attempts to document for or safeguard against public use. 
Use at your own risk.

### A non-exhaustive list of a some of the tools and features contained within:

**[Sous](https://github.com/bottinogames/com.bottinogames.willow.library/tree/master/Runtime/Usefulls/Sous):** A tool for rendering games at low resolution. Will automatically handle rendering to low-res Render Textures and drawing them to screen.

**[I Don't Like UI](https://github.com/bottinogames/com.bottinogames.willow.library/tree/master/Runtime/Usefulls/IDLUI):** A bare-bones "UI" framework, primarily focusing on world-space 3D interfaces. Specifically tailored to my unique blend of UI and 3D. Use with caution.

**[Extensions.cs](https://github.com/bottinogames/com.bottinogames.willow.library/blob/master/Runtime/Extensions.cs):** A collection of extensions I use on a daily basis. Helpful for common applications like `Vector3.Flatten()`.

**[Maths.cs](https://github.com/bottinogames/com.bottinogames.willow.library/blob/master/Runtime/Maths.cs):** An ever growing collection of math functions I use often. Particularly `Maths.Damp()` is used on a daily basis.
